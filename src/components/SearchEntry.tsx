/**
 * Home Page search entry point (Phase 4 scope: navigation/UI foundation
 * only). Submits as a plain GET form — no client-side JavaScript, no
 * search/filter business logic here. /search (Phase 5) will read these
 * same query params and do the real work.
 *
 * Issue #42, Layer B revised Hero direction (comment #5553946233) —
 * this is now a real, fully-functional foreground overlay positioned
 * by Hero.tsx directly on top of the full Hero Master artwork's own
 * decorative search-bar mockup (see Hero.tsx's own header comment for
 * the exact overlay position/rationale), rather than a fixed-width
 * slot below a cropped image. Sizing is entirely controlled by Hero's
 * positioning wrapper (`w-full h-full` here), not by this component.
 * Field labels are `sr-only` (kept for accessibility) since the
 * overlay is compact — placeholder text remains the visible
 * affordance. The real keyword field (`q`) is kept — Issue #40's
 * search-suggestion logic reads this same param, and dropping it would
 * be a functional regression this asset-insertion pass has no business
 * making.
 *
 * Issue #47 round 2: the grid always stays 4 columns/1 row, never
 * stacking to 2x2 below `sm`, now that Hero.tsx positions this overlay
 * with a fixed-percentage height derived from the whole Master image's
 * own single-row search-bar mockup (see Hero.tsx's header comment) —
 * that box is only tall enough for one row at any viewport width. A
 * 2x2 stack overflowed straight out of the box at narrow widths,
 * covering the header/category row underneath it. Fields get
 * genuinely small at 375px as a result — an accepted, explicitly
 * deferred trade-off of this round's whole-image approach (see Hero.tsx),
 * not a separate bug.

          off-center control row inside a taller white pill). `content-center`
